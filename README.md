# Olist Data Visualization Project

This project connects to a PostgreSQL database containing the Olist e-commerce dataset and generates different visualizations (Pie, Bar, Histogram, Scatter, Line, Interactive Plotly) to analyze customer behavior, seller revenue, product characteristics, and sales trends.  

The results are:
- Saved as PNG charts in the `charts/` folder
- Exported as Excel reports with conditional formatting in the `exports/` folder
- Displayed interactively using Plotly (with range slider support)
